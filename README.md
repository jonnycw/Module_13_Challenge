# Venture Funding with Deep Learning
Module 13 Challenge

## Overview

The goal of this project is to use machine learning and neural networks to create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. The project can be broken down into 3 steps:
1. Prepare the data
2. Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
3. Optimize the model

## Installation

This project uses Python 3.8 and requires the below packages:
- pandas
- pathlib
- tensorflow
- keras
- scikit_learn

**_Note: If the user is using macOS, they cannot run the code in Jupyter Lab. Google Collab can be used as an alternative._**
